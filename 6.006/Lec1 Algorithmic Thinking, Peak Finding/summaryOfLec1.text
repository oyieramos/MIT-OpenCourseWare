Divide and Conquer

Divide -> Conquer(find peak recursively)
-> combine(result/s specified)

1D Peak Finding Analysis
Divide Cost: O(1) //constant
Recurrence: T(n) = T (n/2) + O(1)
Combine Cost: O(1)

T(n) = best case - worst case log(base2) n

2D Peak Finding Analysis (size is n x n)
T(n) = T(n/2) + cn
T(n) = best case - worst case (n)
